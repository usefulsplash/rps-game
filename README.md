A simple rock paper scissors game in Python played in the terminal.

## Functionality

This game is a looped instance of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer, complete with Win/Loss/Tie tracking, randomized computer inputs, and play again functionality. The game utilizes both the random and enum modules for the computer's choice and defining "Choice" as a class, respectively. Additionally, the game is separated into functions for easy refactoring later on.

### Possible Improvements

With this implementation, it would be easy to add other options to this simple rock paper scissors game. An example I had seen online would be to turn this game into Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, with two new choices and more win and loss conditionals.
